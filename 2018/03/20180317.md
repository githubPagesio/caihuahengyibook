intolerable to be any other way .as noted earlier,this typically takes about eighteen months ,which in the course of a lifetime is nothing.

are you up for the challenge?

for me ,there is really only one big choice to make in life:
are you willing to fight to find out what's true?
do you deeply believe that finding out what is true is essential to your well-being?
do you have a genuine need to find out if you or others ate doing something wrong that is standing in the way of achiecing your goals?
if your answer to any og these question is no ,accepte that you will never live up fork
the challenge of becoming radically openminded,the first step in doing so is to look at yourself objectively .in the next chapter,understand that people are wired very differently.
you'll have a chance to do just that.
